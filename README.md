# WWDC_18_Submission

## Fire
Fire is a Swift Playground in which I experiment with the concepts of light and motion. Users interact with the world by tiling their device and observing how the torches are respond to the difference in elevation. My inspiration for this playground was Nintendo's "Play First" approach when it comes to making  games. By creating a fun and interesting way to play or interact with the world, one can build unique ways to play and with the core mechanic of the game, and in turn help your game become more accessible at times. 

Intro:
This project is not only my submission for WWDC 2018, but it also my very first playground/project I have created in Swift. I started learning Swift using Playground's "Learn to Code 1 & 2" on my iPad, which I started on March 16th after a friend of mine told me submission would open up soon. I officially began working on the this project March 21st, and completed it on March 31st. 

Planning Phase: 
After completing "Learn to Code 1 & 2" I began by writting down all my ideas and sketching them in my sketchbook. I wanted to focus on creating a game mechanic that would be fun to play around with, and I wanted to create something that I felt I could complete in time, with my limited amount of knowledge. I wanted to do something with Core Motion, and I knew that I wanted to work in a 2D plane, also, so I decided to use SpriteKit and CoreMotion in this project. I spent about two days reading the documentation for both of these and to my suprise, SpriteKit also included 2D ligthing which I wanted to use as well. 

Building Phase: 
The days following up to Sunday I spent them reading the docs, watching youtube videos, and bugging my engineer friends in order to learn everything I needed to learn in order to bring my ideas to fruition.
